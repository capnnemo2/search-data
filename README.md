# Question 2: Millions of Rows of Data

_You have over a million rows of data. You need to display this data on a web page along with a search field. Update search results with each character entered by the user. Make sure to call out any assumptions and / or limitations in your solution._

### Assumptions and Limitations

- The data would be coming from the server and pre-loaded into state.
- It could be better to pre-filter the millions of data (perhaps by broad category) before loading and displaying them all. This would depend on what the user needs.
- The given solution is not case-sensitive, but it could be.
- The inline styling is just there to demonstrate that you wouldn't want your inital list of millions to extend ad nauseum, but would need to be contained. A scrollable field would be a simple solution.
